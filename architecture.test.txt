Imagine a person is using a typical web calendar application using these 4 technologies; MySql, Angular, Node, GraphQl.

Now imagine the person fills in a new event in the calendar app and presses save to create the event.

List the order in which those 4 technologies will be engaged at the moment the user clicks save.

1. Angular
2. GraphQl
3. Node
4. MySQL

Feel free to write any additional thoughts or caveats here:

GraphQl sends query to server.
Node then recieves and parses the query and decides what we want to do with it, likely sending a query to our DB.
